{"instruction": "- **Objective", "response": "** The model is trained to predict choice probabilities by optimizing the utility calculations, likely using maximum likelihood or another suitable loss function."}
{"instruction": "- **Shared Features Layer (`shared_features_layer`)", "response": "** Processes features common across all items and choices, contributing linearly to utilities."}
{"instruction": "- **Items Features Layer (`items_features_layer`)", "response": "** Handles item-specific variations, adding per-item contributions to the utility calculations."}
{"instruction": "- **Residual Layer", "response": "** Introduces nonlinearity into the model by capturing complex patterns in choice residuals that linear components alone might not explain."}
{"instruction": "- **Layers Initialization", "response": "** The code assumes layers are defined elsewhere or initialized during model setup. Knowing how these layers are structured (e.g., number of units, activation functions) is crucial for correct implementation."}
{"instruction": "- **Loss Function and Optimization", "response": "** While the code doesn't explicitly show a loss function, typical models use cross-entropy loss for classification tasks like discrete choice modeling. The training loop likely employs gradient descent or similar optimizers to minimize this loss."}

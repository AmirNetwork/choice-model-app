{"instruction": "{\"instruction\"", "response": "\"Run a basic random utility model (RUM) for mode choice using Reslogit.\", \"response\": \"The model estimates the probability of choosing each transportation mode with coefficients reflecting their relative importance.\"},"}
{"instruction": "{\"instruction\"", "response": "\"Include additional variables like income and price in the RUM.\", \"response\": \"The model now accounts for how economic factors influence mode choice, providing insights into their significance through parameter estimates.\"},"}
{"instruction": "{\"instruction\"", "response": "\"Test for interactions between time and cost in the utility function.\", \"response\": \"Including interaction terms allows assessing whether the effect of one variable (e.g., time) varies with another (e.g., cost), adding flexibility to the model structure.\"},"}
{"instruction": "{\"instruction\"", "response": "\"Check the significance of estimated parameters using p-values.\", \"response\": \"This step verifies which variables have a meaningful impact on mode choice, helping to refine the model by removing insignificant terms.\"},"}

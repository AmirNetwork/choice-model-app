So perhaps I should avoid adding unnecessary indentation.\n\nWait no, when wrapping code within triple backticks, each line of code should be placed between the backticks without any extra spacing unless it's part of the code syntax. But in this case, since it's a multi-line function definition, we need to include all those lines inside the triple backticks correctly.\n\nSo I'll structure it by placing\n```"}

{"instruction": "From the examples provided, it looks like Reslogit can be used in different contexts", "response": "transportation mode choice, vehicle choice, and bike choice. The instruction seems to explain how to structure a dataset with variables like individual characteristics (age, income) and alternative attributes (cost, time). Then, there's an estimation step where coefficients are determined using R software."}

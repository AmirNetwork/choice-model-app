{"instruction": "Looking at the __init__ method more closely", "response": "It takes n_shared_features and n_items_features as arguments, which probably define how many features are shared across all items and how many features each individual item has. Then it initializes weights for these features using normal distributionsâ€”shared_weights is a matrix with rows equal to n_shared_features and columns equal to the number of trainable parameters per feature. Similarly, items_features_weights is a 3D tensor since each item can have its own set of features."}
{"instruction": "In the compute_batch_utility method, it constructs utility matrices by taking shared features and items features, multiplying them with their respective weights, adding an intercept if needed, and then passing through some residual network. So this looks like a two-layer model", "response": "one linear part that captures the deterministic utilities based on features, and a nonlinear part captured by the residual network."}
{"instruction": "- The class uses properties and modular methods to separate concerns", "response": "handling feature weights, defining model indices, computing utilities, and fitting the model."}
